### Project Description
Alora is a web application designed to provide knowledge about menstrual health. The website offers guidance on hygiene, food recommendations, and exercises that can help women during their menstrual period. It aims to combine all these essential features in one platform for easy access.

### The Problem Statement
There are many apps available that cover menstrual health, but few provide an integrated approach combining exercise routines, food recommendations, and hygiene tips. This leaves a gap in users' ability to access holistic, multi-faceted menstrual care on a single platform.

### The Solution
We developed Alora, a website that combines all of these features into one easy-to-use platform. Users can access advice on exercise, food, and hygiene, helping them manage their menstrual health more effectively.
